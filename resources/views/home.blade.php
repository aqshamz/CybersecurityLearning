        <h2>Phishing isn’t just for adults</h2>

        <p><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="8aea3685-acef-445c-9985-8053aef24c56" href="https://www.getcybersafe.gc.ca/en/phishing">Phishing</a> is a tactic that cyber criminals use to steal personal and financial information from their targets. It’s one of the most common cyber threats to Canadians today. While phishing typically happens over email or text messages (which is called <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6a043020-3037-4f4e-b885-fbae3aba9cac" href="https://www.getcybersafe.gc.ca/en/blogs/smishing-introduction">smishing</a>), it can happen just about anywhere online.</p>

        <p>Even if they’re too young for their own cell phone or email address, children can be targeted by scammers pretending to be other players in <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="f61f9b8f-43f0-49bd-a4f4-2a91a3ccd049" href="https://www.getcybersafe.gc.ca/en/blogs/video-game-cyber-security-introduction">video games</a> and friends on messaging apps. They can also be targeted on social media apps like YouTube or TikTok. Phishing messages might include:</p>

        <ul><li>Offers of prizes in exchange for personal information</li>
        <li>Links to <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ee787f87-c632-4086-9c8e-b3048137e422" href="https://www.getcybersafe.gc.ca/en/resources/malware-infographic-detected">malware</a> disguised as “free” games or add-on content (in-game items usually purchased with real-world money)</li>
        <li>Requests for personal information disguised in a fun way (“Did you know that your superhero name is your mother’s maiden name plus the street you live on? Post yours!”)</li>
        </ul><p>Kids today are known for being tech-savvy but knowing how technology works doesn’t protect them from phishing. Teach kids to be wary of requests for information, no matter how good the offer is or how innocent the request sounds.&nbsp; It’s the best way to prevent a child from falling for a phishing scam.</p>

        <h2>Oversharing can lead to compromised accounts</h2>

        <p>When it comes to the internet, not every piece of information needs to be stolen for a criminal to get access to it. If kids aren’t careful with what they share online, they could be <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="806ff401-237f-4430-8a0a-8561caa3b9b9" href="https://www.getcybersafe.gc.ca/en/blogs/cyber-security-kids-introduction#defn-social-media">doing a cyber criminal’s work for them</a>.</p>

        <p>Children don’t always know what information is safe to share and what isn’t. For example, telling everyone at school that it’s your birthday may be a cool thing to do, but sharing that same information online might not be. The same goes for other details that might seem less harmful than they actually are, like their full name, what school they go to or what city they live in.</p>

        <p>Chances are your child’s passwords contain small personal details a cyber criminal would be able to find in the content they share online. By letting kids know to keep that information to themselves and by teaching them to <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5741fd8b-ee18-4ece-a62d-76d65d6fb006" href="https://www.getcybersafe.gc.ca/en/blogs/good-better-best-how-you-can-make-ok-password-even-better">use strong and unique passphrases and passwords</a>, you can help them keep their accounts and devices secure.</p>

        <h2>Malware might look appealing</h2>

        <p><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="02e89315-a715-4d22-8ed4-f50375a42a24" href="https://www.getcybersafe.gc.ca/en/resources/malware-infographic-detected">Malware</a>, short for malicious software, is a type of program that infects your computer or phone with the intention of causing harm. Malware is used to damage or destroy your device, allow cyber criminals to spy on you, steal your personal information or hold your files for ransom.</p>

        <p>Malware is often downloaded through programs or files that seem legitimate. For example, kids might accidentally download malware while trying to install games or apps on their devices.</p>

        <p>It’s important for parents or guardians to take steps to prevent their children from downloading malware. One thing you can do is enable parental controls to restrict what can be downloaded and installed from the internet. You can also encourage kids to ask your permission before downloading or installing any file, and make sure those files are only downloaded from verified sources. And, since we know it’s impossible to keep an eye on kids 24/7, you should install <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e467920b-8907-4cb0-a2ce-cddb54ce16a7" href="https://www.getcybersafe.gc.ca/en/blogs/how-evaluate-anti-virus-software-and-choose-right-one-you">anti-virus software</a> on all your family’s devices for an extra layer of protection.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>

        <p>The internet is home to all sorts of fun content that appeals directly to kids.

                            <p>Cybersecurity is the protection of computers and systems from information theft or damage, in the simplest terms. Learning more about this subject can protect you and your children from the two types of online hazards: social threats, like predators and scammers, and digital threats, like viruses and malware.</p>
                            <p>There are various components of cybersecurity that can be incredibly difficult to grasp, making it much harder to teach to a child. Once you decide what information your kids need, you have to consider how to present it.</p>

                    <p>There are a couple of simple actions you can take to make educating your children a breeze. By simplifying subjects, establishing ground rules, and creating trust, you can not only protect your children online but teach them how to protect themselves.</p>
                    <h3 class="blog-h3-style1 color-orange text-bold">1. Use Child-Friendly Educational Resources.</h3>
                    <p>Cybersecurity can be an incredibly complex subject, so it’s best to find resources tuned to your child’s specific learning level.</p>
                    <div class="content-wrapper" style="display: flex;
                    flex-direction: row;">
                        <div class="text" style="flex: 1;">
                            <p>The most efficient way to do this is to study on your own and distill the language down into child-friendly pieces. No one knows your child better than you, so try to approach the subject in a way you know they’ll understand.</p>
                            <p>For example, younger children might not understand what you mean by saying cybersecurity for kids. If they don’t understand, break that word apart for them.</p>
                            <p>Explain that “Cyber” means taking place on the internet, and “Security” means being safe. Then, they’ll understand you want to talk to them about being safe on the internet.</p>
                            <p>Take each cybersecurity topic with a similar tact: break subjects down and give simple explanations, so your child can understand what is being discussed and how they can apply it.</p>

                    <h3 class="blog-h3-style1 color-orange text-bold">2. Set Up Some Basic Internet Safety Rules for Kids.</h3>
                    <p>Setting up some rules can be a great way to teach your children online boundaries early.</p>
                    <div class="content-wrapper" style="display: flex;
                    flex-direction: row;">

                        <div class="text">
                            <p>These rules should focus on keeping them safe and should usually be guidelines like:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>No giving out information to strangers online: Tell your kids they never should give out personal information on the internet. That means their full name, home address, school, and anything else that could put them in danger.</li>
                                <li>Only visit secure websites: Teach your children what a URL is, and show them the difference between a secure website (HTTPS) and an unsecured website (HTTP).</li>
                                <li>Ask an adult before downloading: Before downloading any file onto their computer, <a class="blue-yes-un" rel="nofollow" href="https://redcanary.com/blog/teaching-basics-cybersecurity-children/" target="_blank">have your child talk to you first</a>. Malware can easily fool children, disguising itself as a game or video they may want to see. While you should also teach them how to tell these files apart, it’s more straightforward in the beginning to ask for permission.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <h3 class="blog-h3-style1 color-orange text-bold">3. Focus On Empowerment.</h3>
                    <p>Children respond to responsibility, and if you give them respect, they are more likely to listen.</p>
                    <div class="content-wrapper" style=" display: flex;
                    flex-direction: row;">
                        <img src="assets/kiddos4.jpg" alt="Image Description">
                        <div class="text" style="margin-left: 20px;">
                            <p>Your children will be online; this is unavoidable. If you empower them and tell them it’s their responsibility to keep their computer secure, you will be amazed at their motivation to do so.</p>
                            <p>Setting a good example is another way to empower your children online. If they see you constantly scrolling, being disrespectful online, or posting inappropriately, they may follow suit. You want their behavior to match yours, so make sure to monitor your own online activity.</p>
                            <p>You also don’t want to talk down to older children when discussing cybersecurity for kids. More often than not, <a class="blue-yes-un" rel="nofollow" href="https://clario.co/blog/teaching-cybersecurity-to-kids/" target="_blank">younger generations know more about technology</a>. Make sure to ask your child just how much they know, so you don’t end up explaining concepts they already understand.</p>
                            <p>Empowerment means trust, and your children will often be alone when surfing the web. It can be scary, but you can’t be around every second. Giving your children trust and responsibility will make them more attentive to their security.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <h3 class="blog-h3-style1 color-orange text-bold">4. Create A Trusting Environment.</h3>
                    <p>That trust will set them up for success online and in life. As long as you let them know they can come to you for guidance, you’ll be surprised at how well your child can do on their own.</p>

                        <div class="text" style="margin-right: 20px;">
                            <p>Of course, you want to make sure to check in with them periodically, and having your rule sheet up and visible doesn’t hurt.</p>
                            <p>That being said, make sure to explain to your children who they should not trust. With many <a class="blue-yes-un" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/family-safety/back-to-school-cybersecurity-habits-for-kids/" target="_blank">kids active on social media</a>, there is an increased chance they could interact with strangers. Tell your kids that stranger danger applies to online interactions as well: If someone you don’t know tries to contact you, inform an adult immediately.</p>
                            <p>You need to trust your children enough to talk to them about cybercrimes. It can be tough to discuss complex subjects like online predators or identity theft with a child, but it’s necessary for <b>cybersecurity for kids</b>. Knowing what threats are out there will help them look out for warning signs and better use online tools to help them stay safe.</p>

                            <p>Some of these tools are free, with the only requirement being that they are activated and regularly updated. You can often set these tools to update automatically, so your children don’t have to worry about doing so manually.</p>
                            <p>Let your children know what an update window may look like so they don’t stop these downloads accidentally. Make sure to inform them that if those programs detect any viruses, come and find an adult as soon as possible.</p>
                            <p>Some tools are entirely free and often not considered safety tools at all, like passwords. Creating a password is a requirement for most online accounts, and children usually make an easy one so they can remember. <a class="blue-yes-un" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.grayanalytics.com/blog/3-practical-ways-to-teach-your-child-about-cybersecurity/" target="_blank">Teach your kids about creating strong passwords</a>, so they can keep their accounts secure and safe.</p>
                            <p>A strong password should have letters (both upper and lower case), symbols, and numbers. Try to find phrases and numbers they are familiar with so that the password is easy for them to understand but difficult for someone trying to steal their information. This is where a password manager can come in handy!</p>
